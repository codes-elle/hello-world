# hello-world
An introduction about me and what I'm learning. Also my progress as I learn programming. 
I have been learning HTML and CSS for almost a month now. My progress and understanding of these languages has greatly improved. I mainly use Codecademy for learning, but I also use other resources to deepen my understanding. I want to be a full stack software developer and learn new languages every month.
